# LLM/OpenAI experiments with MSTICPy

This is an temporary repository to put some MSTICPy LLM/GPT experiments
Initial projects will be to help navigating around MSTICPy functionality
(functions, docs, source code).

I'm working on this in collaboration with @Cyb3rWard0g
and the https://github.com/OTRF/GPT-Security-Adventures repo.
Lots more cool, generic stuff over there.

All the code here requires an OpenAPI subscription and
assumes you have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set with
your OpenAI key.

At some point, depending on interest/reception/how much time I have,
this will be moved to a more official companion repo to
[MSTICPy](https://github.com/microsoft/msticpy)
