    description: Split request into separate tasks to execute
    prompt: |
      You are an assistant that is expert in CyberSecurity concepts.
      You are given request text (enclosed in triple backquotes) that may include multiple tasks:
      ```{request_text}```
      You are asked to split the text into multiple tasks
      and return them as a JSON dictionary of subtasks in the order they appear in the text.
      Try to classify each subtask as one of the following:
          - data_query
          - call_function
          - create_visualization
          - dataframe_operation
      Note that results from data_query, call_function, and dataframe_operation tasks
      will produce a dataframe as a result.

      Use the following format for output using extracted subtask description as the key and the classification as the value:
      "{{
          "tasks": {{
              "subtask description 1": "data_query",
              "subtask description 2": "call_function",
              ..
              "subtask description n": "create_visualization",
          }}
      }}"
